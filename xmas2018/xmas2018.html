            <h1>Seasons Greetings from Doug and Sandy</h1>

            <p>Another trip around our star, and another Christmas letter from Doug and Sandy.</p>

            <p>
                For us, it was a year of the usual stuff, and some not so usual stuff. After taking a break from house hunting in January, we returned to the NSW South Coast to resume
                the search for a place to call home, which meant the usual heading out with the tribe in the kayaks exploring caves ...
            </p>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image"><img alt="Doug in the Blue Cave." src="images/doug-blue-cave.jpg" /></div>
                <div class="image"><img alt="&quot;The Cathedral&quot;." src="images/cathedral-2.jpg" /></div>
            </div>

            <p>... and our beautiful coast.</p>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image"><img alt="Beecroft Peninsula." src="images/rae-greg-beecroft-3.jpg" /></div>
                <div class="image"><img alt="Bunga Head." src="images/tony-rae-john-bunga-head.jpg" /></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The house hunting adventure was a long drawn out and excruciatingly painful affair. By the time Antipidean autumn came around, we'd just about had enough, so
                ventured off for some adventures a bit further afield. We had long aspired to paddle around the stunning Wilsons Promitory, the rugged granite cape that is the
                southern most point of mainland Australia, and is infamous for its 
                fearsome weather. In March, with three other members of the tribe, we had a
                <a href="http://theconspiracytimes.blogspot.com/2018/04/hardly-promenade-around-wilsons.html">grand adventure</a> around The Prom.
            </p>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image"><img alt="Glassy conditions at The Prom ... enjoyable while it lasted." src="images/sandy-neil-sea-eagle-bay-wilsons-prom.jpg" /></div>

            </div>

            <p>
                Later in the fall, a weather window opened up for the mystical <a href="http://theconspiracytimes.blogspot.com/2018/05/kayaking-nadgee-wilderness-coast.html" target="_blank">
                    Nadgee
                </a>, a wild and beautiful coast reveered by ocean kayakers. We nipped off
                with our good mate Snoady for a magnificent trip in ideal conditions: NSW's best multi-day ocean kayak trip.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                And then, after 8 months of real estate shopping, just when we'd pretty much given up, we found a house that ticked off enough
                of the boxes that we bought it a few days later.
                It's a lovely little brick and siding house, with high ceilings to take in the sunny exposure and our small but productive garden.
                We can trolley our kayaks down to the beach in 5 minutes and ride our mountain bikes to the local
                single track in 20 minutes. We are as close to NSW's best rock climbing as we can get without being too near the sprawling
                stressed-out metropolis known as Sydney. Our house backs onto a reserve with towering spotted gums that is stuffed with bower birds,
                blue tongued lizards, and all manner of parrots.
                We are truly blessed with a wonderful group of characters in our tribe and are enthralled with our new place in life.

            <p>And then we did something <i>really</i> crazy. We went skiing. In Australia. And it was good! We're not talking blower pow here, but 
            we had a great time rolling through the high country on a solid 2 m pack. The perfect corn snow made for sweet descents ... if only 
            they were a bit longer.</p>
