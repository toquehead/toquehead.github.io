						<div class="title_nobreak">Shark Bay - Paddling in a Fishbowl</div>
						<div class="subtitle">A sea kayak adventure in Shark Bay, Western Australia</div>
						<P>
							In late March 2003, Sandy and I traveled to beautiful waters of Shark Bay for a 
							9-day sea kayak adventure (shortened from planned 12 due in part to very 
							favorable winds). We have a <A href="http://www.feathercraft.com/" target="_new">
								Feathercraft</A> "folding" double sea kayak. "Folding is a bit of a 
							misnomer: it has a rubber and Cordura skin over an aluminum and plastic frame, 
							and it disassembles into two large <A onclick="img('images/dougcarryingkayak.jpg',400,539,'Half the Feathercraft')" href="javascript:noop();">
								bags/backpacks</A>.</P>
						<P class="section">Where in the world is Shark Bay?</P>
						<P>Shark Bay is on the west coast of Western Australia, about half way up (<A onclick="img('images/map_australia_sharkbay.gif',490,333,'Where in the World is Shark Bay')" href="javascript:noop();">location 
								map</A>). That is a long way from here. Our travel time&nbsp;from Nelson to 
							Shark Bay was&nbsp;52 hours; we enjoyed ourselves&nbsp;in a truck,&nbsp;on 3 
							planes, and 2 buses. The classic movies on the Greyhound were a highlight not 
							to be missed. Full details of our journey are <A href="sharkbaytravel.html" target="_new">
								here</A> for the incurably curious.&nbsp;</P>
						<P>
							Calling it a "Bay" is understated as it is a really big place: roughly speaking 
							it is 200 km north-south by 125 km east-west split into two equal sized bays by 
							the narrow Peron Peninsula (<A onclick="img('images/map_sharkbay.jpg',227,312,'Shark Bay')" href="javascript:noop();">local 
								map</A>).</P>

						<P class="section">An aquarium and a desert</P>
						<P>Shark Bay, like much of central coast of Western Australia, is a land of 
							tremendous contrast. A thin band of white sand and sporadic red sand cliffs 
							separates the Australian desert from the warm, clear waters of the Indian 
							Ocean. The land&nbsp;is dominated by sand, scrub, sand,&nbsp;drought 
							tolerant&nbsp;grasses, sand, and dry salt lake beds (locally called 
							"birridas"). Oh, and lots of red sand. Contrasting the hot dry desert of the 
							land, the waters&nbsp;of Shark Bay, are alive with an awesome density of marine 
							life. Some days we literally felt like we were paddling in a fish bowl.</P>
						<P>Shark Bay is a designated <A href="http://www.sharkbay.org/" target="_new">World 
								Heritage Area</A>, has some very unusual hyper-saline environments, is home 
							to the world's largest concentration of <A href="http://www.sirenia.org/factsheets/dugong.htm" target="_new">
								dugongs</A> as well as incredible numbers of rays, turtles, sea birds, 
							fish, dolphins, and yes, sharks. Lots of sharks. Our boat is very quiet, which 
							allows us&nbsp;to get very close to the animals before they detect us - and 
							then we look like a 19-foot Tiger Shark, so we get&nbsp;to see how fast they 
							can swim.</P>
						<P>As an added&nbsp;bonus, the dark nights and clear desert air combined to provide 
							a spectacular night sky.</P>
						<P align="center"><IMG alt="Evening on the beach" src="images\sharkbay_dougonbeachevening.jpg" align="middle" border="1"></P>

						<P class="section">Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink<br>
							(Or Doug and Sandy Get Bogged)</P>
						<P>
							It is very, very arid in Shark Bay. It essentially doesn't rain unless there is 
							a cyclone (Indian Ocean version of a hurricane). There is no surface water, so 
							we had to carry or stash all that we would need - we estimated we could get by 
							with 7 litres a day for the both of us. With our planned 12-day trip, that's 84 
							litres, and we figured we could carry about 20 litres in addition to all our 
							food and gear, so we had about 70 litres we needed to stash along the way.</P>
						<P>The northern end of Peron Peninsula,&nbsp;around which&nbsp;we paddled, is an 
							old sheep farming station (now <A href="http://www.calm.wa.gov.au/national_parks/previous_parks_month/peron.html" target="_new">
								Francois Peron National Park</A>), and old roads criss-cross 
							it;&nbsp;occasionally they head out to the coast, and these provided perfect 
							locations to stash our water. The terrain isn't terribly rough, but the road 
							surface ranged&nbsp;from very soft sand to extremely soft sand, so it was 4x4 
							travel only. We rented a <A onclick="img('images/sharkbay_truck.jpg',600,322,'Our rental truck on a birrida')" href="javascript:noop();">
								4-wheel drive pickup</A> in Denham and had an exciting day&nbsp;burying our 
							water containers in the sand at 4 locations. Driving in soft sand was a new 
							experience for us, so there were a few lessons to be learned along the way. Our 
							rental "ute" seemed to have about the same horsepower as our blender back home, 
							and&nbsp;to compensate, I resorted to&nbsp;high speed - which made for some 
							white-knuckle driving.&nbsp;Against all odds, we managed to deposit all our 
							water stashes with only minor mishaps. Thinking we were "home and hosed" (as 
							the Australians say), I let my guard down and promptly buried the truck up to 
							its axles in soft sand. After an hour or so of ineffectual digging, a fisherman 
							came along and pulled us out, saving us from a rather long, hot walk back to 
							town.</P>
						<P class="section">Off we go</P>
						<P>Our chosen <A href="sharkbayroutemap.html" target="_new">route</A> was from 
							Denham to Monkey Mia, a distance of about 115 km. On the morning of April 1, we 
							loaded up the kayak and headed north from Denham in the soon-to-be-familiar 
							20-40 km/hr SW&nbsp;tail wind. For the next few days we paddled in shallow 
							water rarely over 1 meter deep - despite being up to 1 km from shore. The tail 
							wind helped ease our out-of-shape middle-aged bodies into the paddling routine.</P>

						<P class="caption" align="center">Camp 2, North of Cape Leseur
							<BR>
							<span class="subcaption">(our blue tent is visible in lower center)</span></P>
						<P>The water was warm and clear with ocassional sea grass beds; the shore was sandy 
							beach with sporadic crumbling <A onclick="img('images/sharkbay_redcliffs.jpg',800,488,'Warm water and red cliffs')" href="javascript:noop();">
								red sandstone cliffs</A>. We soon noticed that we were not alone - 
							countless rays, turtles, all manner of fish, and sharks darted about us at high 
							speed. In the bay we selected for our first campground, Sandra counted about 50 
							sharks, so the place is aptly named. The sharks were reef sharks generally a 
							metre or less in length, so posed no risk to us, but did provide endless 
							entertainment.</P>
						<P align="left">Another common sight were the Cormorants -&nbsp;the healthy fish 
							populations support huge numbers of Cormorants. These birds seem to mostly just 
							hang out on sand bars basking in the sun. In fact, they never seemed to ever 
							fish. As amateur biologists, we declared them a distinct sub-species 
							"Non-Fishing Cormorants" as we began to wonder if they were photosynthetic. In 
							truth, I suspect that the fish life is so abundant, that they need 
							only&nbsp;spend 5 minutes each morning and evening gorging themselves on fish, 
							and then spend the rest of the day chin-wagging back on the sand bar.</P>

							<span class="subcaption">(the&nbsp;one showing you her arm pits is drying her wings, not trying to fly)</span></P>
						<P align="left">As we traveled further from Denham we began to see the graceful <A href="http://www.oceanlight.com/html/manta_birostris.html" target="_new">
								Manta Rays</A>, dolphins, and a few huge Loggerhead (we think) turtles. And 
							some larger "spotted" sharks. These interesting sharks turned out to be the 
							feared Tiger Shark (good thing we didn't know <EM>that</EM> when they cruised 
							by during swims).</P>
						<P align="left">The land, parched and scrubby as it is, supports a surprising 
							diversity of life: emus, kangaroos, lizards, feral sheep and goats.</P>
						<P class="section" align="left">Solitude and&nbsp;fantastic paddling</P>
						<P align="left">We found conditions nearly&nbsp;perfect for kayaking. Generally 
							cloudless skies were a welcome change from the uncertain and changeable weather 
							of Canada's Wet Coast. A stiff SW wind&nbsp;blew day and night:&nbsp;we were 
							kept relatively&nbsp;cool and made good time in the day and bug-free at night. 
							With the shallow&nbsp;water protected from the ocean, even the strong winds 
							generated little more than a one to two foot chop, ideal for cowardly paddlers 
							like ourselves. The tides were very small by Canadian standards (sometimes only 
							2 tides a day, and changes as small as 20 cm), so carries from kayak to camp 
							were short. As icing on the cake, gorgeous sandy <A onclick="img('images/sharkbay_campgregory.jpg',800,515,'Camp on Gregory Beach')" href="javascript:noop();">
								campsites</A> with cliff walking or beachcombing opportunities could be 
							found almost everywhere along the way.</P>
						<P align="left">
							However, when the winds temporarily abated or we came ashore, it was&nbsp;hot. 
							Very hot. Temperatures were in the low to mid 30s, and the sun was incredibly 
							intense. The low scrub found onshore afforded&nbsp;no shade whatsoever, and 
							many days would pass without the sun being obscured by clouds. By afternoon we 
							often felt baked to a crisp and longed for some quality shade. Our only shelter 
							was under our tent fly, but that was a very hot place&nbsp;when the wind 
							relaxed its characteristic fury.</P>
						<P align="left">Despite these overall great conditions, we saw only two other 
							kayakers, and a few vehicles on land.</P>
						<P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images\sharkbay_goatskull.jpg" border="1"></P>
						<P class="caption" align="center">Goat skull</P>
						<P class="section">We turn south and it is payback time, or is it?</P>
						<P>Cape Peron, and our northernmost point, is the meeting of two tidal currents - 
							one from each major bay of Shark Bay, and we had been warned that the water 
							there can be a bit squirrelly. Therefore, we tackled this section early in the 
							day and with a certain amount of trepidation. As so often happens in these 
							situations, it proved to be a non-event; in fact, our passage around&nbsp;Cape 
							Peron was accomplished in some of the calmest water of the entire trip.</P>
						<P>Once the cape was rounded, however, that changed. We ran straight into a howling 
							SE gale with rough water - our anticipated dues for the very favorable winds of 
							the previous week. Our progress slowed from 6 km/hr to 1 or 2 km/hr even with 
							increased effort. We <A onclick="img('images/sharkbay_campcapeperon.jpg',800,533,'Camp just SE of Cape Peron')" href="javascript:noop();">
								made camp</A> early this day and walked to the lighthouse near the cape and 
							watched dolphins from atop seaside cliffs.</P>
						<P>
							After learning that a cyclone was approaching the Australian coast north of us, 
							we pressed on the next day, but luck was with us as the&nbsp;wind dropped 
							during the day. The following&nbsp;two days we couldn't believe our luck as the 
							wind switched to blow from the north for the first time in the trip and pushed 
							us to our pullout spot two days ahead of schedule.&nbsp;Even more luckily, 
							Cyclone Indigo made landfall 500+ km north of us.</P>
						<P>A great trip that I could hardly recommend more enthusiastically to prospective 
							paddlers.</P>
						<P>After this trip, we did some diving at Coral Bay, snorkeled with a 7 m Whale 
							Shark, and then&nbsp; <A href="../ningaloo/ningalooreef.html">paddled 
								Ningaloo Reef</A>.</P>
