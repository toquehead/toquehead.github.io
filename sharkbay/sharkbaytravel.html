						<P>Shark Bay is on the west coast of Western Australia:</P>

						<P align="center">&nbsp;</P>
						<P>
							That is a long way from here. We got from here to there by:</P>
						<OL>
							<LI>
							Driving&nbsp;for 8 hours to Vancouver.
							<LI>
							Taking a 2.5 hour flight from Vancouver to LA.
							<LI>
							Waiting 2 hours in LA for our next flight.
							<LI>
							Flying 12 hours to Auckland (non-stop).
							<LI>
							Waiting 7.5 hours in Auckland for our next flight (it was late).
							<LI>
							Flying for 7 hours to Perth.
							<LI>
							Taking the wonderful Greyhound for another 11 hours to Overlander Roadhouse 
							("Roadhouse" is Australian for a gas station in the middle of nowhere).
							<LI>
							Waiting a few hours at the Overlander for our next bus.
							<LI>
								And finally, riding a bus the last couple hours to Denham.</LI></OL>
						<P>For a total of 54 hours.</P>
						<P>Admittedly, we did spend a couple nights in Vancouver at my folks place, and 
							three nights in Perth visiing friends, but it was still fairly grueling, 
							especially when you consider we were travelling with a kayak and gear totaling 
							100 kg.</P>
