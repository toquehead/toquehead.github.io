            <h1>Wishing You a Very Merry Non-Denominational Christmas</h1>

            <p>And with the completion of another lap around our star, it is time to reflect upon the past year and reconnect with family and 
            friends.</p>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image"><img alt="Our home for the last year." src="images/moruya-house.jpg" /></div>
            </div>

            <p>For the first year in four, we had no significant Australian travels. Late last year, as always, we had extensive and detailed plans 
            for the coming year, and also as always, those plans were abandoned shortly thereafter. To date, our favourite all-round Aussie 
            location is the NSW south coast, around 150-200 km south of Sydney &ndash; it ticks all the boxes: beautiful warm water coastline, temperate 
            climate, away from the city, with easy access to sea kayaking, bush walking, and rock climbing. So when a year-long house-sit came 
            available in this area, it was too tempting to pass up. In the middle of February we moved into a lovely rural home just south of the 
            small town of Moruya on the NSW south coast.</p>

                <div class="image"><img alt="Glasshouse Rocks." src="images/glasshouse-rocks-cemetary-beach.jpg" /></div>
                <div class="image"><img alt="Moruya Heads." src="images/moruya-heads.jpg" /></div>
            </div>

            <p>If last year's <a href="/xmas2015/xmas2015.html">Xmas letter</a> was brought to you by the letter T, this year's letter comes care of the letter P 
            for paddling. The sea kayaking 'round these parts is fantastic, and early on in our stay here, we were lucky enough to get hooked up 
            with a great group of local paddlers, who let us tag along on their trips despite our lack of skill, experience, strength, or any 
            other redeeming characteristics.</p>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image"><img alt="Launching with the tribe from Wimbie Beach." src="images/wimbi-beach-tollgate-islands.jpg" /></div>

            </div>

            <p>Under the tutelage of some very experienced paddlers, we have been testing our limits on the ocean, and steadily increasing our
                skills and confidence. We both love a challenge, and sea kayaking is proving fertile ground for finding challenges and opportunities
                to work on our fear management.</p>

            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image"><img alt="Mark and Sandy at Mystery Bay arch." src="images/mark-sandy-mystery-bay-arch.jpg" /></div>
                <div class="image"><img alt="Sandy at Black Rocks." src="images/sandy-black-rocks.jpg" /></div>
            </div>

            <p>
                We have had many, many wonderful days on the water with our new tribe, exploring the rocky headlands, caves, and islands of this
                section of coast. We have often paddled with seals, rays, sharks, humpback whales, loads of birds, and landed on many beautiful
                secluded beaches &ndash; sometimes even managing to stay upright landing in the surf. We have now paddled a 135km section of the coast
                (north of Ulladulla to south of Narooma).

            </div>

            <p>The climate is very cooperative here, so when we weren't paddling, we were likely walking along the coast or in the hills, with a few road
            trips up onto the Tablelands for rock climbing.</p>

            <p>
                Probably the thing we miss most about being homeless and always travelling is a social group &ndash; it is always just the two of us, and
                as amazing as we are, we miss a sense of community. The local area reminds us of Nelson &ndash; we meet loads of like-minded folk who are
                tree-hugging left-wing pinko commie bastards who have opted-out of the consumer culture and are still out there pushing hard doing the
                things they love well into their 60s and 70s. We couldn't keep up to the genetic mutant senior citizens on skis in Nelson, and we
                can't keep up to their paddling cousins here on the south coast.

            <p>
                Our house-sit is up on February 21, and then we'll be hitting the road again, with plans to make it to the far north of Western
                Australia by mid-winter. But who knows, we could end up anywhere.
