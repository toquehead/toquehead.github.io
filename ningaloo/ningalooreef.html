      <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#C0C0C0">In the far north west of
      Australia, stretching from Bundegi Reef in the north to Amherst Point in
      the south, lies a 260 km long fringing reef.&nbsp; The longest fringing
      reef on a continental land mass, Ningaloo Reef lies, at its nearest point
      100 metres off shore, and 7 km&nbsp; at its furthest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      entire reef is protected by Ningaloo Marine Park which stretches some
      10 nautical miles to sea.&nbsp;&nbsp; In April 2003, we paddled our double
      Feathercraft ocean kayak from Coral Bay in the south to Tantabiddi in the
      north - a distance of around 150 km.&nbsp; Along the way we enjoyed
      lonely camps on white sand beaches, watched shooting stars in the bright
      desert sky, snorkeled over coral filled bays patrolled by reef
      sharks, and paddled along lonely shore lines as turtles surfaced beside
      the kayak.&nbsp; We also fought head winds, struggled with surf landings,
      dodged breaking waves, and ate peanut butter on crackers for lunch for 16
      straight days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#C0C0C0">The
      lagoon inside Ningaloo Reef is ideal for ocean kayaking.&nbsp; The
      paddling is through mostly protected waters with moderate tidal currents
      (average tide is about 2 metres and current about 2 knots).&nbsp; However,
      the reef is not contiguous, and there are several deep water gaps
      which allow the large NW swells into the lagoon.&nbsp; At times, kayakers
      must paddle through these swells&nbsp; and dodge&nbsp; breaking
      waves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surf landings may be necessary.&nbsp; The winds can be
      strong (up to 30 knots), predominantly from the SW, but occasionally out
      of the north.&nbsp; This is desert country and there is no shade and no
      fresh water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#C0C0C0">The
      <a href="images/ningaloomap.bmp">
      map</a> shows our route from Coral Bay to Tantabiddi.&nbsp; We estimated our water
      consumption at 7 litres per day ( a remarkably accurate guess) and, as it
      is impossible to carry 16 days worth of water in the kayak, we left 40
      litres at Ningaloo Homestead, and buried another 30 litres in the sand on
      the shoreline at Yardie Creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

      feels good to leave the commercialization of Coral Bay and paddle north
      through the calm waters of Coral Bay to Point Maud.&nbsp; Just
      north of Point Maud, there are ruins of an old jetty.&nbsp; This is the
      site of the planned <a href="http://www.save-ningaloo.org/">Ningaloo Reef
      Resort</a>, a hotly contentious issue in Australia.&nbsp; North of Point
      Maud there is a large deep water gap in the reef, and as we continue we
      paddle through rolling ocean swells.&nbsp; In Bateman Bay, Indo-Pacific <a href="images/dolphins.jpg"> dolphins</a>
      are jumping out of the water just 30 metres in front of the kayak.&nbsp;
      Our first campsite is tucked behind a rocky reef in Bateman Bay.&nbsp; We
      snorkel for an hour after setting up camp on the beach, and see about
      10 turtles resting in coral nooks or grazing on sea weeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

      three straight days of howling SW winds, the ocean is fairly choppy when
      we launch the kayak at 7.30 am for what we anticipate will be a long
      paddle to the next easy landing site (Point Cloates).&nbsp; The reef is
      patchy and broken for the next 20 km and we expect to be paddling through
      ocean swells.&nbsp; Soon enough we are.&nbsp; </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">Mostly running parallel to the
      ocean swells, with a wind chop behind us and perpendicular to the
      swells.&nbsp; Near Crayfish Reef, breaking waves force us out into Black
      Rock Pass where a current is causing hay stacks to rear dangerously beside
      the kayak.&nbsp; In this deep water pass, turtles are constantly popping
      their heads up beside our kayak; normally, we would paddle around them but
      in this rough water, we just keep going and hope they'll duck under in
      time!&nbsp; At their peak, the swells are running at about three metres
      with a cross-wise wind chop of one metre.&nbsp;</font></p>

      
      
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">Paddling through breaking
      swells in rough water is difficult in a kayak as the paddler is so low to
      the ocean that it is hard to see exactly where the waves are
      breaking.&nbsp; After about four hours of intense paddling we draw close
      to Jane Bay and gain the protection of the fringing reef again.&nbsp;
      However, the steady SW winds have generated a large shore dump and we
      continue paddling for another hour until we round Point Cloates and set up
      camp on a sandy beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3" color="#C0C0C0"> There are huge whalebones on the beach here,
      ribs and vertebrae, sticking out of the sand in odd piles.&nbsp; The old
      Ningaloo Lighthouse rises up on spinifex covered dunes behind camp.&nbsp;
      Much of the Lighthouse, along with the Keeper's cottage still stands, the
      sandstone proving remarkably resilient to the ocean winds.&nbsp; The reef
      is less than a kilometre off shore here and Doug&nbsp; swims out at low
      tide to walk on the dry reef.&nbsp; Over breakfast the next morning, we
      watch a shaggy red fox trot by camp and down to the beach to dig crabs out
      of the sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      and clear turquoise water overlooked by Ningaloo Homestead.&nbsp; We beach
      the kayak and walk up to the Homestead to pick up our water and food
      cache.&nbsp; Jane Lefroy runs Ningaloo Station, a small station by
      Australian standards of only a quarter of a million acres.&nbsp; Her
      mother, Billie, has lived on the station for 53 years.&nbsp; Ningaloo runs
      4,000 head of sheep which are mustered once a year for shearing.&nbsp;
      Every two or three years, Jane also musters up the feral goats and sells
      them for goat meat.&nbsp; It's a hard life in an unforgiving land, rain is
      scarce and there are no natural springs or streams.&nbsp; We repack the
      kayak with our new supplies of fresh water and paddle on to Norwegian Bay
      where we make camp on the beach near the old whaling station.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </p>

      is a very easy paddle on to Winderabandi Point where we camp on a sandy
      beach for two nights.&nbsp; In the middle of Lefroy Bay, as we paddle
      beside leaping Indo-Pacific dolphins we find ourselves crossing over a
      large coral reef.&nbsp; The water is so clear we can see all the coral
      formations and the reef fish.&nbsp; We take a GPS reading so that we can
      come back later in the day to snorkel.&nbsp;&nbsp; After making camp on
      the beach, we paddle the two kilometres back and tie the boat to a piece of dead coral, then
      slide over the side to snorkel for an hour.&nbsp; The coral formations are
      wonderful and Doug watches as a black tip reef shark idly cruises past.&nbsp;
      We stop for two nights at Winderabandi Point and spend hours
      snorkeling over the amazing coral gardens.&nbsp; Reef fish are plentiful
      and a large school of Silver Drummer circle us for us for a
      while.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the night, we are awakened by a loud scratching,
      fearing that some Australian rodent is chewing our tent, we shine the
      flashlight outside only to surprise literally hundreds of <a href="images/crab.jpg">crabs</a>
      that have surrounded the tent and are trying to consume our nalgene
      bottles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

      SW winds have returned as we begin our paddle on to Yardie Creek.&nbsp;
      Before Sandy Point, a gap in the reef lets in the ocean swells and we have
      to detour around breaking waves.&nbsp; In a deserted bay north of
      Sandy Point we stop for lunch and a swim in the crystal clear water.&nbsp;
      As we head off into the strengthening wind, a pod of bottlenose dolphins
      swim by us.&nbsp; There is another large deep water gap in the reef south
      of Yardie Creek, and by the time we reach it, the SW wind is over 30 knots and the seas are piling up dangerously behind us.&nbsp; In this
      rough water, it is almost impossible to see where the swells are breaking;
      so, fearful of even stronger winds, we decide to land the kayak.&nbsp; We
      manage a surf landing on the only strip of sand for kilometres and quickly
      haul the gear and kayak out of the surf zone.&nbsp; The wind blows hard
      for the remainder of the afternoon, so, somewhat reluctantly, we make camp
      for the night.&nbsp; Next morning, the SW has diminished to a moderate 15
      knots and we launch the kayak through the surf and easily reach Yardie
      Creek and our final water cache.&nbsp;</font> </p>

            
      <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">Apparently,
      at very high tides, Yardie Creek floods.&nbsp; Now, however, about 150
      metres of dry sand separates the water of the Gorge and the ocean.&nbsp;
      Deciding we'd like to paddle the Gordge, we laboriously unload the kayak
      and carry all the gear up the beach and stash it in the sand dunes.&nbsp;
      Then we heft the Feathercraft and carry it across to the Gorge.&nbsp; The
      portion of the Gorge that can be paddled is relatively short (1 or 2 km),
      but interesting.&nbsp; Red sandstone cliffs house birds nests and trees
      grow from the cliffs with their roots dangling into space in an attempt to
      reach water.&nbsp; When we can no longer paddle, we tether the kayak and
      hike and scramble further into the Gorge.&nbsp; Although we see a few
      Euros (a type of kangaroo), it is the feral goat that has truly claimed
      the Gorge.&nbsp; For the first time in a month, we see real trees growing!&nbsp;</font> </p>

      fickle wind has died by the time we return to the ocean and reload the
      kayak.&nbsp; So, after a quick swim to cool off, we paddle north
      again.&nbsp; Abruptly, a gust of wind hits, and never leaves, in minutes
      we are paddling in big waves and whitecaps again.&nbsp; At 2.00 pm we
      reach Osprey Bay and stop for the night.&nbsp; We are now in Cape Range
      National Park so we have to abandon our beach camps and set up the tent on

      onto stop on the beach in front of the <a href="http://www.ningalooreefretreat.com/">Ningaloo
      Reef Retreat</a>.&nbsp; Our next campsite is Mandu Mandu, less than 1
      kilometre north but we want to scout the route first, as the reef reaches
      the shore here.&nbsp; Our route is obvious, a passage between waves
      breaking off shore and on shore, and we are through within 15
      minutes.&nbsp; The sole inhabitant of the Mandu Mandu campsite is dozy
      Euro.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> </p>

      snorkeling off the beach, where we see the usual corals, as well as
      stingrays, moray eels, schools of large pelagic fish, turtles, some reef
      sharks, and an unusual sleeping grey shark.&nbsp; One morning, before it
      gets too hot we walk 3 km along the road to Mandu Mandu Gorge and then
      hike the loop hiking trail.&nbsp; The trail climbs to the top of a small
      hill along the edge of the red cliffed Gorge to a view point&nbsp; of
      Ningaloo Reef, then descends into the Gorge and returns on a stony track
      through eucalypt trees.&nbsp; Although, we left the tent first thing in

      back in our faces.&nbsp; We stop at Turquoise Bay to snorkel.&nbsp; The
      water here is deeper than our previous snorkel spots and we see
      correspondingly more marine life.&nbsp; A large stingray is sleeping on
      the sand and a black tip reef shark cruises idly by.&nbsp; I spot a white
      tip reef shark dozing on the sand and swim down for a closer look.&nbsp; I
      must have invaded his/her personal space (I was only a foot or two away)
