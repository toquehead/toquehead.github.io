            money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that
            he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present

		    in the sky - who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the 
		    invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And 
		    if you do any of these ten things, he as a special place, full of fire and 
		    smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live an 
		    sudffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of 
		    time ... But He loves you!<br />

	    <p>The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. - Henry David Thoreau.
	    </p>
	    <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the 
		    essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and 
		    not, when I came to die, to discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to 
		    live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice 
		    resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out 
		    all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout 
		    all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into 
		    a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why 
		    then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to 
		    the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and to be able to 
		    give a true account of it in my next excursion. - Henry David Thoreau
