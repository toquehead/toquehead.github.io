            The secret is not that people genuinely believe an outrageous claim. The secret is that people do genuinely believe that they are in a battle of good against evil, and it is necessary to accept the narrative being promoted, in the interests of fighting evil.

            — Noam Chomsky
        <p>
            Indulgent self-interest that our people once held to be monstrous is now celebrated as success.

            — Robin Wall Kimmerer, "Braiding Sweetgrass"

            The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one’s time defending scoundrels. For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.

            — H.L. Mencken

            The civilization now in jeopardy is all humanity. As the ancient myth makers knew, we are children equally of the earth and sky. In our
            tenure on this planet, we have accumulated dangerous, evolutionary baggage – propensities for aggression and ritual, submission to leaders,
            hostility to outsiders, all of which puts our survival in some doubt. We have also acquired compassion for others, love for our children,
            a desire to learn from history and experience, and a great, soaring passionate intelligence – the clear tools for our continued survival and prosperity.

            Which aspects of our nature will prevail is uncertain, particularly when our visions and prospects are bound to one small part of the small
            planet earth. But up and in the cosmos, an inescapable perspective awaits. National boundaries are not evidenced when we view the earth from space.
            Fanatic ethnic or religious or national identifications are a little difficult to support when we see our planet as a fragile, blue crescent fading
            to become an inconspicuous point of light against the bastion and citadel of the stars.

            There are not yet obvious signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, and this makes us wonder whether civilizations like ours rush inevitably
            into self-destruction. I dream about it... and sometimes they are bad dreams.

            — Carl Sagan

            Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive… those who torment us for our own good
            will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.
            — CS Lewis

            First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
            Because I was not a socialist.

            Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
            Because I was not a trade unionist.

            Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
            Because I was not a Jew.

            Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
            — Martin Niemöller

            The whole secret of investment is to find places where it’s safe and wise to non-diversify. It’s just that simple. Diversification is for the know-nothing investor; it’s not for the professional.
            – Charlie Munger

            We must admit that our opponents in this argument have a marked advantage over us. They need only a few words to set forth a half-truth; whereas, in order to show that it is a half-truth, we have to resort to long and arid dissertations.
            – Frédéric Bastiat, Economic Sophisms, 1848

            I have had many troubles in my life, most of which have never happened.

            I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time when the United States is a service and information economy;
            when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the
            hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability
            to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes,
            our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide,
            almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.
            –  Carl Sagan.

            I preferred questions that cannot be answered to answers than cannot be questioned.

            Sometimes I think I’m too easily distracted. I was once told that my mind doesn’t just wander, it runs around screaming in its underpants.

            If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking.

            As a gray-haired alpinista, you’ve spent more than half a century struggling on high escarpments, inventing purpose out of hardship, and conjuring meaning from otherwise senseless acts.
            – Jon Krakauer
        </p>

            The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits.
            – Albert Einstein

            Not everything which can be measured counts, and not everything which counts can be measured.

            "Man…. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices
            money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that
            he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present
            or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never
            really lived."

            Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man - living
            in the sky - who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the
            invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And
            if you do any of these ten things, he as a special place, full of fire and
            smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live an
            sudffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of
            time ... But He loves you!<br />

            The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. - Henry David Thoreau.

        <p>
            I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the
            essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and
            not, when I came to die, to discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to
            live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice
            resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out
            all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout
            all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into
            a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why
            then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to
            the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and to be able to
            give a true account of it in my next excursion. - Henry David Thoreau

        <p>
            As if you could kill time without injuring eternity. - Henry David Thoreau.

            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
            <br />
            I took the one less travelled by,
            <br />
            And that has made all the difference. - Robert Frost.
